# Project
This project provides tips and techniques for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

This project focuses on several key areas:
1. **Data Preprocessing for RAG**: This includes extracting text data from various document formats (PDF, Word, HTML), Text Standardization and Normalization, and Chunking Optimization for RAG.
2. **Index Design for Retriever**: This involves creating efficient and scalable indices to improve retrieval speed and accuracy, choosing the right indexing structures, and handling updates to the index.
3. **Query Optimization**: This includes techniques for crafting effective queries using various search methods such as keyword-based, vector-based, and hybrid approaches. It also covers query expansion techniques to enhance search results such as Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE) methods.
4. **Evaluation**: This involves setting up benchmarks, selecting appropriate evaluation metrics, and conducting experiments to measure the performance of the RAG system.
